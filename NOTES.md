# NOTES.md

This is where I am at with this project...

LEFT OFF ( version "1.0.ape.5" )
* tweaked and simplified logging... 

NEXT
* log page tweaks
    + wire clear()
    + wire scroll to bottom
    + fix formatting (do dangle doesn't happen on debug page)

FUTURE
* bypass startpage (and go to hint, status, or onboarding page)
* add color to config
* have boilerplate for starting projects
* adjust gitignore
    + so needed XML files are part of repo
